# GPA-Calculation-Project-
This is my Computer Science first semester project. It is designed to calculate the GPA of any semester. The user can input the subject names, credit hours, and grades, and the system will automatically calculate the GPA based on the given data. This project helps students easily track their academic performance without doing manual calculations.
